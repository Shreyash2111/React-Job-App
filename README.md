Description:

- This is a React job application with the help of which you can see,post,update and delete jobs.
- It has different sections for home,jobs and adding jobs.
- It has a fully responsive design on every devices.

Concepts used:

- I have used different hooks like usestate,useeffect,useloaderdata,useparams.
- Used react-router-dom for routing with different pages like home,jobs,add-job,particular job.
- Used React-Toastify,Spinners to give a more good UI interaction for the user.
- Used Render for rendering json server to get data.
- Also used CRUD operations for the job.
- Also used React-icons

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh
